## 🚀 About Me

My journey in technology began in 2014 when I was 15 years old when I started robotics classes and participated in my first [Brazilian Robotics Olympics (OBR)](https://obr.robocup.org.br) competition and came in 3rd place, but I didn't stop there, the following year I participated again in the OBR and came 1st place in the regional phase, this allowed me to go to the final stages of the Olympics in which I was national champion in Brazil (And Yes, Brazil is huge!). Being a national champion, my dreams had already come true, and I was classified for to [ROBOCUP 2016](https://2016.robocup.org/web/index-2.html) (that year was in Leipzig - Germany) representing Brazil in the Rescue Line Jr competitions. And that's how my love for technology began and I gave up thinking about studying ⚖️ Law in the future.

A few years later, in 2018, I decided to ✈️ change countries and study computer engineering in Portugal and now I am a 🎓 Computer Engineer. I'm also finishing my master's degree in IPLeiria and I am a 🔬 Researcher Fellow in Augmented/Mixed Reality and Digital Twins in Industry and I have a published work in: [2023 International Conference on Graphics and Interaction (ICGI)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/10452727/proceeding) - [Augmented Reality and Digital Twin for Mineral Industry](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10452719)

I am passionet for 🥽 Augmented Reality and Software Development.
